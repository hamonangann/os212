Well, I regularly do what I want. However, it will be annoying if I do nothing when I need to do something :D. By the way, I am not sure I remember what I've done yesterday, or what I'll do tommrrow, so here's [my log.](TXT/mylog.txt) **Que sera sera!**

I am also not sure I remember all my Google searches. Don't worry, I have some [links](./LINKS/) that I think are useful...

```c
printf("Have a nice day!");
